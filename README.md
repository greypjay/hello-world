Well hello there. While I have used git on a UNIX system, I have never ventured into the profound waters of github. I hope that there is no stormy weather ahead, but who am I kidding? This is real life we're talking about here. None of that "the world is your oyster" crap that gets shoved down your throat as a child, and no more coddling either. Tell me like it is, straight.

That's a big reason I enjoy programming; I can directly affect the world around me. So when I'm feeling happy I can make beautiful patterns with electronics and LEDS. When I'm feeling somewhat more destructive, or if someone just pisses me off, I can fire up the spinning robot and destroy a few things. All in the name of ... err Science? Now fuck off.
